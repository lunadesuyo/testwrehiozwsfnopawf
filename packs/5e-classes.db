Divine radiance shines from her hands, the man’s wounds knit closed, and his eyes open wide with amazement.</p><p>A dwarf crouches behind an outcrop, his black cloak making him nearly invisible in the night, and watches an orc war band celebrating its recent victory. Silently, he stalks into their midst and whispers an oath, and two orcs are dead before they even realize he is there.</p><p>Silver hair shining in a shaft of light that seems to illuminate only him, an elf laughs with exultation. His spear flashes like his eyes as he jabs again and again at a twisted giant, until at last his light overcomes its hideous darkness.</p><p>Whatever their origin and their mission, paladins are united by their oaths to stand against the forces of evil. Whether sworn before a god’s altar and the witness of a priest, in a sacred glade before nature spirits and fey beings, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witness, a paladin’s oath is a powerful bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion.</p><h2>The Cause of Righteousness</h2><p>A paladin swears to uphold justice and righteousness, to stand with the good things of the world against the encroaching darkness, and to hunt the forces of evil wherever they lurk. Different paladins focus on various aspects of the cause of righteousness, but all are bound by the oaths that grant them power to do their sacred work. Although many paladins are devoted to gods of good, a paladin’s power comes as much from a commitment to justice itself as it does from a god.</p><p>Paladins train for years to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so, their martial skills are secondary to the magical power they wield: power to heal the sick and injured, to smite the wicked and the undead, and to protect the innocent and those who join them in the fight for justice.</p><h2>Beyond the Mundane Life</h2><p>Almost by definition, the life of a paladin is an adventuring life. Unless a lasting injury has taken him or her away from adventuring for a time, every paladin lives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle against evil. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of the militias and armies of the world, but even fewer people can claim the true calling of a paladin. When they do receive the call, these warriors turn from their former occupations and take up arms to fight evil. Sometimes their oaths lead them into the service of the crown as leaders of elite groups of knights, but even then their loyalty is first to the cause of righteousness, not to crown and country.</p><p>Adventuring paladins take their work seriously. A delve into an ancient ruin or dusty crypt can be a quest driven by a higher purpose than the acquisition of treasure. Evil lurks in dungeons and primeval forests, and even the smallest victory against it can tilt the cosmic balance away from oblivion.</p><h3>Multiclassing</h3><p>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player’s Handbook, here’s what you need to know if you choose paladin as one of your classes.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Minimum.</strong> As a multiclass character, you must have at least a Strength or Charisma score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a paladin.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies Gained.</strong> If paladin isn’t your initial class, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a paladin: light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons.</p><p><strong>Spell Slots.</strong> You are a half caster. Add half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin class to the appropriate levels from other classes to determine your available spell slots.</p><p>Please refer to the @UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-journals.a5xwmx4d5X1FHEct]{Multiclassing Rules} for additional information on multiclassing.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB","identifier":"paladin","levels":1,"hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"3m97wkjvvpmoj773","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{}},{"_id":"z5a36g2fz47slvfv","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.mpsqZa6TuvoKJNQ8","Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.T6La8PzJ61KXKDR0"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":1,"title":"Paladin Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"2fqoffbqldswvted","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.LIrZMOsGDezlJBX7","Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.S6a6Qv4SUOZ8ADJo","Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.xDUcpIzgrtlqREJf"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":2,"title":"Paladin Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"u2kradulnxe9cgpr","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.9Yw1eaXXYs2qclDx","Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.muz7rfO3qdoNVPNY","Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.BdhVFmTGhjLm1Ceo"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":3,"title":"Paladin Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"9tq7f2jr56dgir39","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.bAyhm1qJWAMu2kl1"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":4,"title":"Paladin Feature","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ffxr3p69kluj0ocx","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.emc1sH5Qjp54shjz"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":5,"title":"Paladin Feature","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"7wsd1p0fmisk2gjo","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.A4Hxmse28oUuaLfe"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":6,"title":"Paladin Feature","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"artbvikeuwkginr6","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.HiizEejyxUXmyToM"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":10,"title":"Paladin Feature","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ebnhdptiulcsl7v2","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.Gl2gHboUJK1z7uDQ"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":14,"title":"Paladin Feature","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"j3ygu7qiv1fwecvf","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.t02O9KxEfdYmeORT"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":11,"title":"Paladin Feature","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["wis","cha"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["ath","ins","itm","med","per","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"half","ability":"cha"},"subclass":"","damage":{"parts":[]},"critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null}},"ownership":{"default":0,"LCw1mxC8S2Al3dWA":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1665521007210,"lastModifiedBy":"UjfixXuqstXNdypa"}}

As an inferno rages around her foes, leathery wings spread from her back and she takes to the air.</p><p>Long hair whipped by a conjured wind, a half-elf spreads his arms wide and throws his head back. Lifting him momentarily off the ground, a wave of magic surges up in him, through him, and out from him in a mighty blast of lightning.</p><p>Crouching behind a stalagmite, a halfling points a finger at a charging troglodyte. A blast of fire springs from her finger to strike the creature. She ducks back behind the rock formation with a grin, unaware that her wild magic has turned her skin bright blue.</p><p>Sorcerers carry a magical birthright conferred upon them by an exotic bloodline, some otherworldly influence, or exposure to unknown cosmic forces. One can’t study sorcery as one learns a language, any more than one can learn to live a legendary life. No one chooses sorcery; the power chooses the sorcerer.</p><h2>Raw Magic</h2><p>Magic is a part of every sorcerer, suffusing body, mind, and spirit with a latent power that waits to be tapped. Some sorcerers wield magic that springs from an ancient bloodline infused with the magic of dragons. Others carry a raw, uncontrolled magic within them, a chaotic storm that manifests in unexpected ways.</p><p>The appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly unpredictable. Some draconic bloodlines produce exactly one sorcerer in every generation, but in other lines of descent every individual is a sorcerer. Most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as apparent flukes. Some sorcerers can’t name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their own lives. The touch of a demon, the blessing of a dryad at a baby’s birth, or a taste of the water from a mysterious spring might spark the gift of sorcery. So too might the gift of a deity of magic, exposure to the elemental forces of the Inner Planes or the maddening chaos of Limbo, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality.</p><p>Sorcerers have no use for the spellbooks and ancient tomes of magic lore that wizards rely on, nor do they rely on a patron to grant their spells as warlocks do. By learning to harness and channel their own inborn magic, they can discover new and staggering ways to unleash that power.</p><h2>Unexplained Powers</h2><p>Sorcerers are rare in the world, and it’s unusual to find a sorcerer who is not involved in the adventuring life in some way. People with magical power seething in their veins soon discover that the power doesn’t like to stay quiet. A sorcerer’s magic wants to be wielded, and it has a tendency to spill out in unpredictable ways if it isn’t called on.</p><p>Sorcerers often have obscure or quixotic motivations driving them to adventure. Some seek a greater understanding of the magical force that infuses them, or the answer to the mystery of its origin. Others hope to find a way to get rid of it, or to unleash its full potential. Whatever their goals, sorcerers are every bit as useful to an adventuring party as wizards, making up for a comparative lack of breadth in their magical knowledge with enormous flexibility in using the spells they know.</p><h3>Multiclassing</h3><p>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player’s Handbook, here’s what you need to know if you choose sorcerer as one of your classes.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Minimum.</strong> As a multiclass character, you must have at least a Charisma score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a sorcerer.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies Gained.</strong> If sorcerer isn’t your initial class, you gain no proficiencies when you take your first level as a sorcerer.</p><p><strong>Spell Slots.</strong> You are a full caster.

Boon</h3><p>Each Pact Boon option produces a special creature or an object that reflects your patron’s nature.</p><p><em><strong>Pact of the Chain. </strong></em>Your familiar is more cunning than a typical familiar. Its default form can be a reflection of your patron, with imps and quasits tied to the Fiend.</p><p><em><strong>Pact of the Blade. </strong></em>If you serve the Fiend, your weapon could be an axe made of black metal and adorned with decorative flames.</p><p><em><strong>Pact of the Talisman.</strong> </em>Your patron bestows a magical talisman upon you that can help you succeed in all your endeavors.</p><p><em><strong>Pact of the Tome. </strong></em>Your Book of Shadows could be a weighty tome bound in demon hide studded with iron, holding spells of conjuration and a wealth of forbidden lore about the sinister regions of the cosmos, a gift of the Fiend.</p><hr /><h1>The Warlock</h1><p>With a pseudodragon curled on his shoulder, a young elf in golden robes smiles warmly, weaving a magical charm into his honeyed words and bending the palace sentinel to his will.</p><p>As flames spring to life in her hands, a wizened human whispers the secret name of her demonic patron, infusing her spell with fiendish magic.</p><p>Shifting his gaze between a battered tome and the odd alignment of the stars overhead, a wild-eyed tiefling chants the mystic ritual that will open a doorway to a distant world.</p><p>Warlocks are seekers of the knowledge that lies hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. Through pacts made with mysterious beings of supernatural power, warlocks unlock magical effects both subtle and spectacular. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of beings such as fey nobles, demons, devils, hags, and alien entities of the Far Realm, warlocks piece together arcane secrets to bolster their own power.</p><h2>Sworn and Beholden</h2><p>A warlock is defined by a pact with an otherworldly being. Sometimes the relationship between warlock and patron is like that of a cleric and a deity, though the beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are not gods. A warlock might lead a cult dedicated to a demon prince, an archdevil, or an utterly alien entity — beings not typically served by clerics. More often, though, the arrangement is similar to that between a master and an apprentice. The warlock learns and grows in power, at the cost of occasional services performed on the patron’s behalf.</p><p>The magic bestowed on a warlock ranges from minor but lasting alterations to the warlock’s being (such as the ability to see in darkness or to read any language) to access to powerful spells. Unlike bookish wizards, warlocks supplement their magic with some facility at hand-to-hand combat. They are comfortable in light armor and know how to use simple weapons.</p><h2>Delvers into Secrets</h2><p>Warlocks are driven by an insatiable need for knowledge and power, which compels them into their pacts and shapes their lives. This thirst drives warlocks into their pacts and shapes their later careers as well.</p><p>Stories of warlocks binding themselves to fiends are widely known. But many warlocks serve patrons that are not fiendish. Sometimes a traveler in the wilds comes to a strangely beautiful tower, meets its fey lord or lady, and stumbles into a pact without being fully aware of it. And sometimes, while poring over tomes of forbidden lore, a brilliant but crazed student’s mind is opened to realities beyond the material world and to the alien beings that dwell in the outer void.</p><p>Once a pact is made, a warlock’s thirst for knowledge and power can’t be slaked with mere study and research. No one makes a pact with such a mighty patron if he or she doesn’t intend to use the power thus gained. Rather, the vast majority of warlocks spend their days in active pursuit of their goals, which typically means some kind of adventuring. Furthermore, the demands of their patrons drive warlocks toward adventure.</p><h3>Multiclassing</h3><p>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player’s Handbook, here’s what you need to know if you choose warlock as one of your classes.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Minimum.</strong> As a multiclass character, you must have at least a Charisma score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a warlock.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies Gained.</strong> If warlock isn’t your initial class, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a warlock: light armor, simple weapons.</p><p><strong>Spell Slots.</strong> You utilize pact magic. Do not add any warlock levels to the levels of other classes to determine your spellcasting level. Instead, any spell slots gained from your warlock levels are added directly to your spell slots gained from any other spellcasting classes.</p><p>Please refer to the @UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-journals.a5xwmx4d5X1FHEct]{Multiclassing Rules} for additional information on multiclassing.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB","identifier":"warlock","levels":1,"hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"awwdyedrr2q28g64","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{}},{"_id":"jtgxek0gu7hs0sao","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.rJlMyXIAB7ZcTLRE"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":2,"title":"Warlock Feature","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"xo6csuypzad0fh6u","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.MKwqTl6B24sT1OMB"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":3,"title":"Warlock Feature","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"jlssrnufezw4h3qj","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.bAyhm1qJWAMu2kl1"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":4,"title":"Warlock Feature","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"esyuuyb4b68m54b6","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.3D94BbH1WuYPzMCl"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":11,"title":"Warlock Feature","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"idy5vrsebwmsfqps","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.ynH1cG1bbYV9Ipcb"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":20,"title":"Warlock Feature","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"roxim8rlykflhfn3","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.1Pc4f4mIeuXtf7Ah","Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.apPfqevYW5APWhXx"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":1,"title":"Warlock Feature","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"irtmu07o88nlql5n","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"","type":"string","distance":{"units":""},"scale":{"11":{"value":"6th-level Spell"},"13":{"value":"7th-level Spell"},"15":{"value":"8th-level Spell"},"17":{"value":"9th-level Spell"}}},"value":{},"title":"Mystic Arcanum","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["wis","cha"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","dec","his","itm","inv","nat","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"pact","ability":"cha"},"subclass":"","damage":{"parts":[]},"critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null}},"ownership":{"default":0,"LCw1mxC8S2Al3dWA":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1665523031474,"lastModifiedBy":"9DrM9sBIPMUTBZIH"}}

An elf behind her, clad in studded leather armor, peppers the goblins with arrows loosed from his exquisite bow. The half-orc nearby shouts orders, helping the two combatants coordinate their assault to the best advantage.</p><p>A dwarf in chain mail interposes his shield between the ogre's club and his companion, knocking the deadly blow aside. His companion, a half-elf in scale armor, swings two scimitars in a blinding whirl as she circles the ogre, looking for a blind spot in its defenses.</p><p>A gladiator fights for sport in an arena, a master with his trident and net, skilled at toppling foes and moving them around for the crowd's delight — and his own tactical advantage. His opponent's sword flares with blue light an instant before she sends lightning flashing forth to smite him.</p><p>All of these heroes are fighters, perhaps the most diverse class of characters in the worlds of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries, and bandit kings — as fighters, they all share an unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. And they are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face.</p><h2>Well-Rounded Specialists</h2><p>Fighters learn the basics of all combat styles. Every fighter can swing an ace, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a fighter is adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization makes fighters superior combatants on battlefields and in dungeons alike.</p><h2>Trained for Danger</h2><p>Not every member of the city watch, the village militia, or the queen's army is a fighter. Most of these troops are relatively untrained soldiers with only the most basic combat knowledge. Veteran soldiers, military officers, trained bodyguards, dedicated knights, and similar figures are fighters.</p><p>Some fighters feel drawn to use their training as adventurers. The dungeon delving, monster slaying, and other dangerous work common among adventurers is second nature for a fighter, not all that different from the life he or she left behind. There are greater risks, perhaps, but also much greater rewards — few fighters in the city watch have the opportunity to discover a magic <em>flame tongue</em> sword, for example.</p><h3>Multiclassing</h3><p>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player’s Handbook, here’s what you need to know if you choose fighter as one of your classes.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Minimum.</strong> As a multiclass character, you must have at least a Strength or Dexterity score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a fighter.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies Gained.</strong> If fighter isn’t your initial class, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a fighter: light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons.</p><p><strong>Spell Slots.</strong> If you take the Eldritch Knight subclass, you are a third caster.

The magic of his song fortifies and emboldens them.</p><p>Laughing as she tunes her cittern, a gnome weaves her subtle magic over the assembled nobles, ensuring that her companions' words will be well received.</p><p>Whether scholar, skald, or scoundrel, a bard weaves magic through words and music to inspire allies, demoralize foes, manipulate minds, create illusions, and even heal wounds.</p><h2>Music and Magic</h2><p>In the world of D&amp;D, words and music are not just vibrations of air, but vocalizations with power all their own. The bard is a master of song, speech, and the magic they contain. Bards say that the multiverse was spoken into existence, that the words of the gods gave it shape, and that echoes of these primordial Words of Creation still resound throughout the cosmos. The music of bards is an attempt to snatch and harness those echoes, subtly woven into their spells and powers.</p><p>The greatest strength of bards is their sheer versatility. Many bards prefer to stick to the sidelines in combat, using their magic to inspire their allies and hinder their does from a distance. But bards are capable of defending themselves in melee if necessary, using their magic to bolster their swords and armor. Their spells lean toward charms and illusions rather than blatantly destructive spells. They have a wide-ranging knowledge of many subjects and a natural aptitude that lets them do almost anything well. Bards become masters of the talents they set their minds to perfecting, from musical performance to esoteric knowledge.</p><h2>Learning from Experience</h2><p>True bards are not common in the world. Not every minstrel singing in a tavern or jester cavorting in a royal court is a bard. Discovering the magic hidden in music requires hard study and some measure of natural talent that most troubadours and jongleurs lack. It can be hard to spot the difference between these performers and true bards, though. A bar's life is spent wandering across the land gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer. But a depth of knowledge, a level of musical skill, and a touch of magic set bards apart from their fellows.</p><p>Only rarely do bards settle in one place for long, and their natural desire to travel — to find new tales to tell, new skills to learn, and new discoveries beyond the horizon — makes an adventuring career a natural calling. Every adventure is an opportunity to learn, practice a variety of skills, enter long-forgotten tombs, discover lost works of magic, decipher old tomes, travel to strange places, or encounter exotic creatures. Bards love to accompany heroes to witness their deeds firsthand. A bard who can tell an awe-inspiring story from personal experience earns renown among other bards. Indeed, after telling so many stories about heroes accomplishing mighty deeds, many bards take these themes to hear and assume heroic roles themselves.</p><h3>Multiclassing</h3><p>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player’s Handbook, here’s what you need to know if you choose bard as one of your classes.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Minimum.</strong> As a multiclass character, you must have at least a Charisma score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a bard.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies Gained.</strong> If bard isn’t your initial class, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a bard: light armor, one skill of your choice, one musical instrument of your choice.</p><p><strong>Spell Slots.</strong> Add all of your bard class levels to the appropriate levels from other classes to determine your available spell slots.</p><p>Please refer to the @UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-journals.a5xwmx4d5X1FHEct]{Multiclassing Rules} for additional information on multiclassing.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB","identifier":"bard","levels":1,"hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"jhn9ujyzevjte66x","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{}},{"_id":"bzj4q9vi32j98gaq","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.k2Z8DkSNtYVeo0dt","Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.7Q7X8BnKOsk2SXSt"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":1,"title":"Bard Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"dkyl0nqpxkh4x2mx","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.k4LVEvCK7z7uRy50","Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.mHVbJjJdbG0kD9Ft"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":2,"title":"Bard Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"05gmlp9k5mkhcrkb","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.C9Fes8I6yYqQdYiu","Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.cJnWTuyQIQ4QtqZk"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":3,"title":"Bard Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"mvv0coqdc8gfk0sk","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.bAyhm1qJWAMu2kl1"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":4,"title":"Bard Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"t7e1g6fbdyf9xaz9","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.dzaYShQbEkLwawXr"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":5,"title":"Bard Feature","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"wc60zc4ztzmcic0s","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.GchMVtDO4gC7bFA5"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":6,"title":"Bard Feature","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"m4eppoaa1qzpo3hx","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.cJnWTuyQIQ4QtqZk","Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.L88KQ8jJAzTKGqB3"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":10,"title":"Bard Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"tv5fipmj9ebxt9bv","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.DjVTolmWdSQK0VTk"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":20,"title":"Bard Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"33g9jum1x8gak31w","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"","type":"dice","distance":{"units":""},"scale":{"1":{"n":1,"die":6},"5":{"n":1,"die":8},"10":{"n":1,"die":10},"15":{"n":1,"die":12}}},"value":{},"title":"Inspiration Die","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ind68050whivj8y6","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"","type":"dice","distance":{"units":""},"scale":{"2":{"n":1,"die":6},"9":{"n":1,"die":8},"13":{"n":1,"die":10},"17":{"n":1,"die":12}}},"value":{},"title":"Song of Rest","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["dex","cha"],"skills":{"number":3,"choices":["acr","ani","arc","ath","dec","his","ins","itm","inv","med","nat","prc","per","prf","rel","slt","ste","sur"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"cha"},"subclass":"","damage":{"parts":[]},"critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null}},"ownership":{"default":0,"LCw1mxC8S2Al3dWA":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1665520246257,"lastModifiedBy":"UjfixXuqstXNdypa"}}

denote her station, an elf closes her eyes to shut out the distractions of the battlefield and begins her quiet chant. Fingers weaving in front of her, she completes her spell and launches a tiny bead of fire toward the enemy ranks, where it erupts into a conflagration that engulfs the soldiers.</p><p>Checking and rechecking his work, a human scribes an intricate magic circle in chalk on the bare stone floor, then sprinkles powdered iron along every line and graceful curve. When the circle is complete, he drones a long incantation. A hole opens in space inside the circle, bringing a whiff of brimstone from the otherworldly plane beyond.</p><p>Crouching on the floor in a dungeon intersection, a gnome tosses a handful of small bones inscribed with mystic symbols, muttering a few words of power over them. Closing his eyes to see the visions more clearly, he nods slowly, then opens his eyes and points down the passage to his left.</p><p>Wizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, wizards cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and brute-force mind control. Their magic conjures monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, or turns slain foes into zombies. Their mightiest spells change one substance into another, call meteors down from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.</p><h2>Scholars of the Arcane</h2><p>Wild and enigmatic, varied in form and function, the power of magic draws students who seek to master its mysteries. Some aspire to become like the gods, shaping reality itself. Though the casting of a typical spell requires merely the utterance of a few strange words, fleeting gestures, and sometimes a pinch or clump of exotic materials, these surface components barely hint at the expertise attained after years of apprenticeship and countless hours of study.</p><p>Wizards live and die by their spells. Everything else is secondary. They learn new spells as they experiment and grow in experience. They can also learn them from other wizards, from ancient tomes or inscriptions, and from ancient creatures (such as the fey) that are steeped in magic.</p><h2>The Lure of Knowledge</h2><p>Wizards’ lives are seldom mundane. The closest a wizard is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer in a library or university, teaching others the secrets of the multiverse. Other wizards sell their services as diviners, serve in military forces, or pursue lives of crime or domination.</p><p>But the lure of knowledge and power calls even the most unadventurous wizards out of the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most wizards believe that their counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.</p><h3>Multiclassing</h3><p>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player’s Handbook, here’s what you need to know if you choose wizard as one of your classes.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Minimum.</strong> As a multiclass character, you must have at least an Intelligence score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a wizard.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies Gained.</strong> If wizard isn’t your initial class, you gain no proficiencies when you take your first level as a wizard.</p><p><strong>Spell Slots.</strong> You are a full caster. Add all of your wizard class levels to the appropriate levels from other classes to determine your available spell slots.</p><p>Please refer to the @UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-journals.a5xwmx4d5X1FHEct]{Multiclassing Rules} for additional information on multiclassing.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB","identifier":"wizard","levels":1,"hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"djjxwc0gobejui6s","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{}},{"_id":"vu3qrmyr9xowv4mf","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.54VuBQRbwSNd9rOc","Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.F8leKDyrAUoErtwN"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":1,"title":"Wizard Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"2n4tbmtodua423i8","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.CqhFOojEcLwo8jok"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":2,"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"riuc3q6xe1jmfjj2","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.bAyhm1qJWAMu2kl1"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":4,"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"5qrbbe4ij6865tbc","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.9YwTpLh8lnskvHkK"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":18,"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"hd9zohdpisyun1vh","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.i7JZoQ16QSkKRdB8"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":20,"title":"Wizard Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"bpl5mszncstitoyf","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"","type":"number","distance":{"units":""},"scale":{"1":{"value":3},"4":{"value":4},"10":{"value":5}}},"value":{},"title":"Cantrips Known","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"subclass":"","damage":{"parts":[]},"critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null}},"ownership":{"default":0,"LCw1mxC8S2Al3dWA":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1665522574254,"lastModifiedBy":"UjfixXuqstXNdypa"}}

Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.</p><h3>Multiclassing</h3><p>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player’s Handbook, here’s what you need to know if you choose hunter as one of your classes.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Minimum.</strong> As a multiclass character, you must have at least a Wisdom score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a hunter.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies Gained.</strong> If hunter isn’t your initial class, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a hunter: light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons, one skill from the class's skill list.</p><p><strong>Spell Slots.</strong> You are a half caster.

collapsing dazed. A human, her eyes still glowing with unearthly power, tosses a few extra coins on the bar. \"Sorry for the mess. If he wakes up, tell him to try picking on someone his own size next time\".</p><p>The prisoner's expression turns from defiant to puzzled as the interrogator asks no questions, merely stares at them silently. His puzzled expression turns worried as he finds himself, unbidden, recalling where he stashed the loot. \"Under the stables behind the Rusty Hook Inn\" the interrogator finally speaks, as the thief's expression becomes terrified.</p><p>\"Ain't you... cold or somethin'?\" the dwarf asks the elf as they trudge through the snow, eying her simple robe and bare feet. \"I just think 'warm'\" the elf replies with a distracted air. The dwarf snorts, a puff of chilled air. Typical elf nonsense. Except... they haven't frozen to death yet. \"Say... could you think some 'warm' this way?\" the dwarf asks hopefully. To the dwarf’s surprise, the chill of the snow fades away completely. \"That's downright creepy... hey don't stop now! Was jus' sayin' it was creepy.\"</p><p>Psions are those who have tapped into a special otherworldly force, with the ability to actualize the power of their mind to accomplish impossible feats. Reading minds, lifting vast weights, and transcending physical limitations, they tend to inspire awe and terror in equal measure.</p><p>The exact nature of what psionic power is might be a question answered in your setting, or it might not be. Most view psionic power as coming from within, though other answers exist - anything from the leaking power of the Far Realm, to an alternate way to express magic, to an actualization of an individual's will upon the world.</p><h2>Powerful Minds</h2><p>Since a psion's weapon is their mind, they are always a careless thought away from harming those around them. For a psion, the line between thinking and doing can be very thin, forcing them to keep their thoughts and emotions in check, lest their powers run amok. This leads to many of them developing odd behaviors or mannerisms to help them control their state of mind, frequently seeming quite eccentric to an outside observer.</p><p>Consider how your psion keeps their powers in check, and how much their power bleeds into their everyday life. How reading minds may affect their body language or habits. Do they add wood to the campfire from the comfort of their bedroll, or do they restrain themselves from using their power for trivial matters lest they slip up?</p><h2>Misunderstood Power</h2><p>In a world of widespread magic, many will assume a psion to be a type of Sorcerer or Wizard, mistaking their powers for the common applications of magic. The common villager keeps only one mental category for the supernatural and creepy people that bend reality to their will. But even among magic users, a psion's powers will frequently be found unnerving.</p><p>It is often those who do understand magic that find a psion’s abilities the most aberrant. A force that intersects the magical weave rather than obeys it, the nature of the power that the psion wields one can only contemplate with unease.</p><h3>Multiclassing</h3><p>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player’s Handbook, here’s what you need to know if you choose psion as one of your classes.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Minimum.</strong> As a multiclass character, you must have at least an Intelligence score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a psion.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies Gained.</strong> If psion isn’t your initial class, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a psion: light armor, simple weapons.</p><p>Please refer to the @UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-journals.a5xwmx4d5X1FHEct]{Multiclassing Rules} for additional information on multiclassing.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"KCCC*","identifier":"psion","levels":1,"hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"E8hzwhRQrlHlSWbc","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{}},{"_id":"UWBgVKZB49OvVUcP","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.66uX8Ai7pHusnvdv","Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.HRtWGx0N8KNMVurs"],"optional":false,"spell":null},"value":{},"level":1,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"zsrwdLMorlFcMRbz","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"","type":"number","distance":{"units":""},"scale":{"1":{"value":1},"2":{"value":2},"3":{"value":3},"4":{"value":4},"5":{"value":5},"6":{"value":6},"7":{"value":7},"8":{"value":8},"9":{"value":9},"10":{"value":10},"11":{"value":11},"12":{"value":12},"13":{"value":13},"14":{"value":14},"15":{"value":15},"16":{"value":16},"17":{"value":17},"18":{"value":18},"19":{"value":19},"20":{"value":20}}},"value":{},"title":"Psi Points","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"8DjPOBDmJWdbE8ts","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"","type":"number","distance":{"units":""},"scale":{"1":{"value":1},"3":{"value":2},"5":{"value":3},"7":{"value":4},"9":{"value":5},"11":{"value":6},"13":{"value":7},"15":{"value":8},"17":{"value":9},"19":{"value":10}}},"value":{},"title":"Psi Limit","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"SElq4uHIH3F9dPcM","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.1IpSLpLQUw5UOKeQ"],"optional":false,"spell":null},"value":{},"level":2,"title":"Feature","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"QX5WEO53mZaDwqsg","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.ZxxZ2aHJQLT2WVyh"],"optional":false,"spell":null},"value":{},"level":3,"title":"Feature","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"IGKMu3nHXp5cAll2","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.bAyhm1qJWAMu2kl1"],"optional":false,"spell":null},"value":{},"level":4,"title":"Optional Feature","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"GBkqVKcCOymeUwUE","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.vX8wvBt0G5641Skw"],"optional":false,"spell":null},"value":{},"level":5,"title":"Feature","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"aH4K5OPHZkKQEakx","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.JMEqRa7ZmoE7iaoM"],"optional":false,"spell":null},"value":{},"level":11,"title":"Feature","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"k90a5v9HUjk7fF7D","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.chTap06eHLmS0x1p"],"optional":false,"spell":null},"value":{},"level":20,"title":"Feature","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"RtMJ5wt6qDK4Khhz","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.y0NlUVnxlKHOwTpN"],"optional":true,"spell":null},"value":{},"level":20,"title":"Optional Feature","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"HdI6VA11r3j6UO9V","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.UOmLTQCKjisWJBPb"],"optional":false,"spell":null},"value":{},"level":18,"title":"Feature","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"BM5EJnwsykDpLh30","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"","type":"number","distance":{"units":""},"scale":{"2":{"value":2},"5":{"value":3},"7":{"value":4},"9":{"value":5},"12":{"value":6},"15":{"value":7},"18":{"value":8}}},"value":{},"title":"Psionic Talents","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["dex","cha"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["dec","his","ins","itm","inv","med","prc","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":"int"},"subclass":"","damage":{"parts":[]},"critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null}},"ownership":{"default":0,"LCw1mxC8S2Al3dWA":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.290","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1668836628428,"lastModifiedBy":"UjfixXuqstXNdypa"}}

He laughs as he charges toward the frost giant who dared poach his people's elk herd.</p><p>A half-orc snarls at the latest challenger to her authority over their savage tribe, ready to break his neck with her bare hands as she did the last six rivals.</p><p>Frothing at the mouth, a dwarf slams his helmet into the face of his drow foe, then turns to drive his armored elbow into the gut of another.</p><p>These barbarians, different as they might be, are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.</p><p>For some, their rage springs from a communion with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling reservoir of anger at a world full of pain. For every barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.</p><h2>A Life of Danger</h2><p>Not every member of the tribes deemed \"barbarians\" by scions of civilized society has the barbarian class. A true barbarian among these people is as uncommon as a skilled fighter in a town, and he or she plays a similar role as a protector of the people and a leader in times of war. Life in the wild places of the world is fraught with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying monsters. Barbarians charge headlong into that danger so that their people don't have to.</p><p>Their courage in the face of danger makes barbarians perfectly suited for adventuring. Wandering is often a way of life for their native tribes, and the rootless life of the adventurer is little hardship for barbarian. Some barbarians miss the close-knit family structures of the tribe, but eventually find them replaced by the bonds formed among the members of their adventuring parties.</p><h3>Multiclassing</h3><p>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player’s Handbook, here’s what you need to know if you choose barbarian as one of your classes.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Minimum.</strong> As a multiclass character, you must have at least a Strength score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a barbarian.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies

They see magic as a complex system waiting to be decided and then harnessed in their spells and inventions. You can find everything you need to play one of these inventors in the next few sections.</p><p>Artificers use a variety of tools to channel their arcane power. To cast a spell, an artificer might use alchemist's supplies to create a potent elixir, calligrapher's tools to craft a temporary charm. The magic of artificers is tied to their tools and their talents, and few other characters can produce the right tool for a job as well as an artificer.</p><h2>Artificers in Many Worlds</h2><p>Throughout the D&amp;D multiverse, artificers create inventions and magic items of peace and war. Many lives have been brightened or saved because of the work of kind artificers, but countless lives have also been lost because of the mass destruction unleashed by certain artificers' creations.</p><p>In the Forgotten Realms, the island of Lantan is home to many artificers, and in the world of Dragonlance, tinker gnomes are often members of this class. The strange technologies in the Barrier Peaks of the world of Greyhawk have inspired some folk to walk the path of the artificer, and in Mystara, various nations employ artificers to keep airships and other wondrous devices operational.</p><p>Artificers in the City of Sigil share discoveries from throughout the multiverse, and from there, the gnome artificer Vi runs a cosmo-spanning business that hires adventurers to fix problems that others deem unfixable. In Vi's home world, Eberron, magic is harnessed as a form of science and deployed throughout society, largely as a result of the wondrous ingenuity of artificers.</p><h3>Multiclassing</h3><p>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player’s Handbook, here’s what you need to know if you choose artificer as one of your classes.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Minimum.</strong> As a multiclass character, you must have at least an Intelligence score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already an artificer.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies Gained.</strong> If artificer isn’t your initial class, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as an artificer: light armor, medium armor, shields, thieves’ tools, tinker’s tools.</p><p><strong>Spell Slots.</strong> You are a half caster. Add half your levels (rounded up) in the artificer class to the appropriate levels from other classes to determine your available spell slots.</p><p>Please refer to the @UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-journals.a5xwmx4d5X1FHEct]{Multiclassing Rules} for additional information on multiclassing.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"TCE","identifier":"artificer","levels":1,"hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"29c81a6uyu7p9ny4","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"4uxyyvz0nu65p1wp","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"","type":"number","distance":{"units":""},"scale":{"2":{"value":4},"6":{"value":6},"10":{"value":8},"14":{"value":10},"18":{"value":12}}},"value":{},"title":"Infusions Known","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"m5nmxwmz4oed670s","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"","type":"number","distance":{"units":""},"scale":{"2":{"value":2},"6":{"value":3},"10":{"value":4},"14":{"value":5},"18":{"value":6}}},"value":{},"title":"Infused Items","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"umdjcmoa9sj0dtgp","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.I0pr0WP873mZBnpk","Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.QyDLOWVLIxU4KDEN"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":1,"title":"Artificer Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"gx69zgien6f3hd67","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.MN8Bu2KpsRwxN1Bc"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":2,"title":"Artificer Feature","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"c9haba5wvebd0dzk","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.VtWTsSI8iW057IAP","Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.5q54ZQeDuQAlr6ek"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":3,"title":"Artificer Feature","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"7zkfclsfrwbi3uil","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.bAyhm1qJWAMu2kl1"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":4,"title":"Artificer Feature","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"6f60kn1hl87yzx6n","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.vwgtd61MGBR67P3d"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":6,"title":"Artificer Feature","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"c0ieqercvxli8j4k","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.OuWOlZf2wS7t6he1"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":7,"title":"Artificer Feature","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ylm1nm35aeq8hkk0","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.sYCeaQEmlschHs5a"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":10,"title":"Artificer Feature","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"zl4rjjten8csm129","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.yTFDfSfLEKdgHhDN"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":11,"title":"Artificer Feature","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"y1a4sc08s4oy8sqe","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.vTZxj7flmsDFVqsa"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":14,"title":"Artificer Feature","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"wqsw1uvqq08dgmil","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.YWkC2MfY6SAISDFA"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":18,"title":"Artificer Feature","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"f7zy7qhad65ukdd0","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.tzDAgjUBpEwjA2U5"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":20,"title":"Artificer Feature","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"rrfMNhUsNfHzfKZA","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"","type":"number","distance":{"units":""},"scale":{"2":{"value":1},"10":{"value":2}}},"value":{},"title":"Adv Infusion","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["con","int"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","inv","med","nat","prc","slt"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"artificer","ability":"int"},"subclass":""},"ownership":{"default":0,"LCw1mxC8S2Al3dWA":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.290","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1669115329161,"lastModifiedBy":"9DrM9sBIPMUTBZIH"}}

She whirls among them, knocking their blows aside and sending them reeling, until at last she stands alone.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, a human covered in tattoos settles into a battle stance. As the first charging orcs reach him, he exhales and a blast of fire roars from his mouth, engulfing his foes.</p><p>Moving with the silence of the night, a black-clad halfling steps into a shadow beneath an arch and emerges from another inky shadow on a balcony a stone’s throw away. She slides her blade free of its cloth-wrapped scabbard and peers through the open window at the tyrant prince, so vulnerable in the grip of sleep.</p><p>Whatever their discipline, monks are united in their ability to magically harness the energy that flows in their bodies. Whether channeled as a striking display of combat prowess or a subtler focus of defensive ability and speed, this energy infuses all that a monk does.</p><h2>The Magic of Ki</h2><p>Monks make careful study of a magical energy that most monastic traditions call ki. This energy is an element of the magic that suffuses the multiverse — specifically, the element that flows through living bodies. Monks harness this power within themselves to create magical effects and exceed their bodies’ physical capabilities, and some of their special attacks can hinder the flow of ki in their opponents. Using this energy, monks channel uncanny speed and strength into their unarmed strikes. As they gain experience, their martial training and their mastery of ki gives them more power over their bodies and the bodies of their foes.</p><h2>Training and Asceticism</h2><p>Small walled cloisters dot the landscapes of the worlds of D&amp;D, tiny refuges from the flow of ordinary life, where time seems to stand still. The monks who live there seek personal perfection through contemplation and rigorous training. Many entered the monastery as children, sent to live there when their parents died, when food couldn’t be found to support them, or in return for some kindness that the monks had performed for their families.</p><p>Some monks live entirely apart from the surrounding population, secluded from anything that might impede their spiritual progress. Others are sworn to isolation, emerging only to serve as spies or assassins at the command of their leader, a noble patron, or some other mortal or divine power.</p><p>The majority of monks don’t shun their neighbors, making frequent visits to nearby towns or villages and exchanging their service for food and other goods. As versatile warriors, monks often end up protecting their neighbors from monsters or tyrants.</p><p>For a monk, becoming an adventurer means leaving a structured, communal lifestyle to become a wanderer. This can be a harsh transition, and monks don’t undertake it lightly. Those who leave their cloisters take their work seriously, approaching their adventures as personal tests of their physical and spiritual growth. As a rule, monks care little for material wealth and are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than merely slaying monsters and plundering their treasure.</p><h3>Multiclassing</h3><p>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player’s Handbook, here’s what you need to know if you choose monk as one of your classes.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Minimum.</strong> As a multiclass character, you must have at least a Dexterity or Wisdom score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a monk.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies Gained.</strong> If monk isn’t your initial class, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a monk: simple weapons, shortswords.</p><p>Please refer to the

She presses an ear to the door, then pulls out a set of tools and picks the lock in the blink of an eye. Then she disappears into the shadows as her fighter friend moves forward to kick the door open.</p><p>A human lurks in the shadows of an alley while his accomplice prepares for her part in the ambush. When their target — a notorious slaver — passes the alleyway, the accomplice cries out, the slaver comes to investigate, and the assassin’s blade cuts his throat before he can make a sound.</p><p>Suppressing a giggle, a gnome waggles her fingers and magically lifts the key ring from the guard’s belt. In a moment, the keys are in her hand, the cell door is open, and she and her companions are free to make their escape.</p><p>Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes’ vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party.</p><h2>Skill and Precision</h2><p>Rogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of a variety of skills as they do to perfecting their combat abilities, giving them a broad expertise that few other characters can match. Many rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine the skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks.</p><p>When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning over brute strength. A rogue would rather make one precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will hurt the target most, than wear an opponent down with a barrage of attacks. Rogues have an almost supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn magical tricks to supplement their other abilities.</p><h2>A Shady Living</h2><p>Every town and city has its share of rogues. Most of them live up to the worst stereotypes of the class, making a living as burglars, assassins, cutpurses, and con artists. Often, these scoundrels are organized into thieves’ guilds or crime families. Plenty of rogues operate independently, but even they sometimes recruit apprentices to help them in their scams and heists. A few rogues make an honest living as locksmiths, investigators, or exterminators, which can be a dangerous job in a world where dire rats — and wererats — haunt the sewers.</p><p>As adventurers, rogues fall on both sides of the law.

They claim no mastery over nature. Instead, they see themselves as extensions of nature's indomitable will.</p><h2>Power of Nature</h2><p>Druids revere nature above all, gaining their spells and other magical powers either from the force of nature itself or from a nature deity. Many druids pursue a mystic spirituality of transcendent union with nature rather than devotion to a divine entity, while others server gods of a wild nature, animals, or elemental forces. The ancient druidic traditions are sometimes called the Old Faith, in contrast to the worship of gods in temples and shrines.</p><h2>Preserve the Balance</h2><p>For druids, nature exists in a precarious balance. The four elements that make up a world — air, earth, fire, and water — must remain in equilibrium. If one element were to gain power over the others, the world could be destroyed, drawn into one of the elemental planes and broken apart into its component elements. Thus, druids oppose cults of Elemental Evil and others who promote one element to the exclusion of others.</p><p>Druids are also concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life, and the need for civilizes folk to live in harmony with nature, not in opposition to it. Druids accept that which is cruel in nature, and they hate that which is unnatural, including aberrations (such as beholders and mind flayers) and undead (such as zombies and vampires). Druids sometimes lead raids against such creatures, especially when the monsters encroach on the druids' territory.</p><p>Druids are often found guarding sacred sites or watching over regions of unspoiled nature. But when a significant danger arises, threatening nature's balance or the lands they protect, druids take on a more active role in combating the threat, as adventurers.</p><h2>Sacred Plants and Wood</h2><p>A druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.</p><p>Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.</p><p>Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.</p><h2>Druids and the Gods</h2><p>Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"dnd5e.rules\" data-id=\"2JNtWRo7wMq08bXn\">appendix PH-B</a> include many such deities). The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples.</p><h3>Multiclassing</h3><p>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player’s Handbook, here’s what you need to know if you choose druid as one of your classes.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Minimum.</strong> As a multiclass character, you must have at least a Wisdom score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a druid.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies Gained.</strong> If druid isn’t your initial class, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a druid: light armor, medium armor, shields (druids will not wear armor or use shields made of metal).</p><p><strong>Spell Slots.</strong> You are a full caster.

Cleric</h1><p>Arms and eyes upraised toward the sun and a prayer on his lips, an elf begins to glow with an inner light that spills out to heal his battle-worn companions.</p><p>Changing a song of glory, a dwarf sings his ace in wide swaths to cut through the ranks of orcs arrayed against him, shouting praise to the gods with every foe's fall.</p><p>Calling down a curse upon the forces of undeath, a human lifts her holy symbol as a light pours from it to drive back the zombies crowding in on her companions.</p><p>Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distance planes of the gods. As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities. No ordinary priest, a cleric is imbued with divine magic.</p><h2>Healers and Warriors</h2><p>Divine magic, as the name suggests, is the power of the gods, flowing from them into the world. Clerics are conduits for that powers, manifesting it as miraculous effects. The gods don't grant this power to everyone who seeks it, but only to those chosen to fulfill a high calling.</p><p>Harnessing divine magic doesn't rely on study or training. A cleric might learn formulaic prayers and ancient rites, but the ability to cast cleric spells relies on devotion and an intuitive sense of a deity's wishes.</p><p>Clerics combine the helpful magic of healing and inspiring their allies with spells that harm and hinder foes. They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of plague or poison, and even call down flames from heaven to consume their enemies. For those evildoers who will benefit most from a mace to the head, clerics depend on their combat training to let them wade into melee with the power of the gods on their side.</p><h2>Divine Agents</h2><p>Not every acolyte or officiant at a temple or shrine is a cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their gods' will through prayer and sacrifice, not by magic and strength of arms. In some cities, priesthood amounts to a political office, viewed as a stepping stone to higher positions of authority and involving no communion with a god at all. True clerics are rare in most hierarchies.</p><p>When a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually because his or her god demands it. Pursuing the goals of the gods often involves braving dangers beyond the walls of civilization, smiting evil or seeking holy relics in ancient tombs. Many clerics are also expected to protect their deities' worshippers, which can mean fighting rampaging orcs, negotiating peace between warring nations, or sealing a portal that would allow a demon prince to enter the world.</p><p>Most adventuring clerics maintain some connection to established temples and orders of their faiths. A temple might ask for a cleric's aid, or a high priest might be in a position to demand it.</p><h3>Multiclassing</h3><p>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player’s Handbook, here’s what you need to know if you choose cleric as one of your classes.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Minimum.</strong> As a multiclass character, you must have at least a Wisdom score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a cleric.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies Gained.</strong> If cleric isn’t your initial class, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a cleric: light armor, medium armor, shields.</p><p><strong>Spell Slots.</strong> You are a full caster.
