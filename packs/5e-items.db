Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your alignment to change. Lawful becomes chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa.

If you single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or group of monsters you encounter, you gain experience points enough to gain one level. Otherwise, this card has no effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Donjon</strong>. You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can't be located by any divination magic, but a @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.3okM6Gn63zzEULkz]{Wish} can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.</p>\n<p><strong>Euryale</strong>.

Only a god or the magic of <strong>The Fates</strong> card can end this curse.</p>\n<p><strong>The Fates</strong>. Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.</p>\n<p><strong>Flames</strong>. A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.</p>\n<p><strong>Fool</strong>. You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level.</p>\n<p><strong>Gem</strong>. Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at your feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Idiot</strong>. Permanently reduce your Intelligence by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.</p>\n<p><strong>Jester</strong>. You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.</p>\n<p><strong>Key</strong>. A rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears in your hands.

The fighter is of the same race as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character.</p>\n<p><strong>Moon</strong>.

Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.</p>\n<p><strong>Skull</strong>. You summon an avatar of death - a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the GM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death.

You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill, and you double your proficiency bonus on checks made with that skill. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world.

You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation. For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells. </p>\n<p><strong>Replacing the Book</strong> </p>\n<p>You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book - for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell. </p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place. The Book's Appearance. Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes.

The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.</p>\n<p>As the wizard towers fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons.</p>\n<p>Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb.</p>\n<p>An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.</p>\n<p>While attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb's depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become charmed by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it.</p>\n<p>While you are charmed by the orb, you can't voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb casts @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.zMAWdyc8UVb37BK4]{Suggestion} on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Tiamat, or something else the GM decides.</p>\n<h3 id=\"random-properties\"><strong>Random Properties</strong>. An Orb of Dragonkind has the following random properties (see DMG pg. 219-21): </h3>\n<ul>\n<li>2 minor beneficial properties </li>\n<li>1 minor detrimental property</li>\n<li>1 major detrimental property</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"spells\"><strong>Spells</strong>. The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: </h3>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.uUWb1wZgtMou0TVP]{Cure Wounds} (5th-level version, 3 charges)</li>\n<li>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.BP3GCwa66IAw1yTG]{Daylight} (1 charge)</li>\n<li>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.VtCXMdyM6mAdIJZb]{Death Ward} (2 charges)</li>\n<li>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.fVbCxFRaORalHB20]{Scrying} (3 charges).</li>\n<li>You can also use an action to cast the @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.ghXTfe7sgCbgf1Q8]{Detect Magic} spell from the orb without using any charges.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Call Dragons</strong>. While you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can't be used again for 1 hour.</p>\n<p><strong>Destroying an Orb</strong>. An Orb of Dragonkind appears fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the attacks and breath weapons of dragons. A @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.HBHbOGKNVVprSlwn]{Disintegrate} spell or one good hit from a +3 magic weapon is sufficient to destroy an orb, however.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"DMG. pg 225","quantity":1,"weight":5,"price":500000,"attunement":1,"equipped":false,"rarity":"artifact","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":0,"units":""},"target":{"value":0,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":7,"max":7,"per":"day"},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"util","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"wis","dc":18,"scaling":"flat"},"armor":{"value":0,"type":"trinket","dex":0},"hp":{"value":0,"max":0,"dt":null,"conditions":""},"baseItem":"","speed":{"value":null,"conditions":""},"strength":0,"stealth":false,"proficient":false,"attributes":{"spelldc":10}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"4lCdaYwhvK1T68Lv":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.items.1RwJWOAeyoideLKe"}},"_id":"VMT4Mj3wmtt9Ujr0"}
