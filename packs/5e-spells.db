For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich’s life drain attack⁠.</li>\n<li>You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent’s successful save, a foe’s critical hit, or a friend’s failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game.

While mounted on it, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target the mount. The mount disappears temporarily when it drops to 0 hit points or when you dismiss it as an action. Casting this spell again re-summons the bonded mount, with all its hit points restored and any conditions removed. You can’t have more than one mount bonded by this spell or find steed at the same time. As an action, you can release a mount from its bond, causing it to disappear permanently. Whenever the mount disappears, it leaves behind any objects it was wearing or carrying.</p><p><strong>Spell Lists.</strong> Paladin</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"XGE","activation":{"type":"minute","cost":10,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":"inst"},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":30,"long":null,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":"","recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"level":4,"school":"con","components":{"value":"","vocal":true,"somatic":true,"material":false,"ritual":false,"concentration":false},"materials":{"value":"","consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"prepared","prepared":false},"scaling":{"mode":"none","formula":""}},"effects":[],"ownership":{"default":0,"KEn0n6JsNNAtXIka":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.d8Q9EecUU6QvXbIr"},"rest-recovery":{"data":{"recovery":{"enabled":false}}}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1665642825500,"modifiedTime":1666242243550,"lastModifiedBy":"UjfixXuqstXNdypa"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"CjZFATF4c5fJfPLe"}

The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.</p>\n<p>The glyph is nearly Invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.</p>\n<p>You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most Common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.</p>\n<p>You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to Physical Characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect Aberrations or drow), or Alignment. You can also set Conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.</p>\n<p>When you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph.</p>\n<p><strong>Explosive Runes</strong>. When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on the glyph. The Sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\n<p><strong>Spell Glyph</strong>. You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it Targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful Objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and Attack it.

Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy’s sanctum⁠ but instead viewed an illusion⁠, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.</p><p><strong>On Target</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.</p><p><strong>Off Target</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p><p><strong>Similar Area</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard’s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p><p><strong>Mishap</strong>. The spell’s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":"inst"},"target":{"value":9,"width":null,"units":"","type":"creature"},"range":{"value":10,"long":0,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":0,"max":"0","per":"","recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"util","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":"","value":""},"formula":"1d100","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell","value":""},"level":7,"school":"con","components":{"value":"","vocal":true,"somatic":false,"material":false,"ritual":false,"concentration":false},"materials":{"value":"","consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"prepared","prepared":false},"scaling":{"mode":"none","formula":""}},"ownership":{"default":0,"LCw1mxC8S2Al3dWA":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1664782133877,"lastModifiedBy":"UjfixXuqstXNdypa"}}

You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.</p><h3>Flood</h3><p>You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land, instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave’s path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.</p><p>The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.</p><h3>Part Water</h3><p>You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell’s area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.</p><h3>Redirect Flow</h3><p>You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell’s area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.</p><h3>Whirlpool</h3><p>This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (<strong>Athletics</strong>) check against your spell save DC.</p><p>When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes [[/r 2d8]] bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn’t caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (<strong>Athletics</strong>) check to do so.</p><p>The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes [[/r 2d8]] bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.</p><p><strong>Spell Lists.</strong> @UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-journals.7iH4qANs2gxn0MIs.JournalEntryPage.G7cm1ctzhtxEOvxS]{Cleric}, @UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-journals.7iH4qANs2gxn0MIs.JournalEntryPage.1IHQ3bZ4aCi15dlH]{Druid}, @UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-journals.7iH4qANs2gxn0MIs.JournalEntryPage.5YX3k6END6NQWHOB]{Wizard}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":10,"units":"minute"},"target":{"value":100,"width":null,"units":"ft","type":"cube"},"range":{"value":300,"long":0,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":0,"max":"0","per":"","recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"save","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null},"damage":{"parts":[["2d8","bludgeoning"]],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"str","dc":0,"scaling":"spell"},"level":4,"school":"trs","components":{"value":"","vocal":true,"somatic":true,"material":true,"ritual":false,"concentration":true},"materials":{"value":"A drop of water and a pinch of dust.","consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"prepared","prepared":false},"scaling":{"mode":"none","formula":""}},"ownership":{"default":0,"LCw1mxC8S2Al3dWA":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1668160819750,"lastModifiedBy":"EHpONhziSoZpUpN3"}}
