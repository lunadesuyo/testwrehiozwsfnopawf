Tempest gods send their clerics to inspire fear in the common folk, either to keep those folk on the path of righteousness or to encourage them to offer sacrifices of propitiation to ward off divine wrath.</p>\n<h3>Tempest Domain Spells</h3>\n<table>\n<thead style=\"text-shadow:1px 1px var(--color-shadow-dark);border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-border-dark)\">\n<tr>\n<td>Cleric Level</td>\n<td>Spells</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.zjff2IdTPpUwWCUj]{Fog Cloud}, @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.SHmTDvXfGItXBTs6]{Thunderwave}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.NJoboox7UplFADzn]{Gust of Wind}, @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.6GqRMNBXcKg4Z6x7]{Shatter}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.bsmm4jV1tMjyU00g]{Call Lightning}, @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.sNfU0BaHmjqml2zk]{Sleet Storm}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.uLXgUtgVTI6Qiyyn]{Control Water}, @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.rdiygKbI2F4JWVgd]{Ice Storm}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.2QHWawdXbC6WLHNx]{Destructive Wave}, @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.ppzHP9AZKXu2IWyz]{Insect Plague}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Tempest Domain Features</h3>\n<p>1st Level: @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.OOjymxRt3nYW4Vkq]{Bonus Proficiencies}, @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.OIKVjdXT1T8PZAMm]{Wrath of the Storm}</p>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.46WyZOUsnGrZ2cJ3]{Channel Divinity: Destructive Wrath}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.8cIdV2EU7BC8MW1m]{Thunderous Strike}</p>\n<p>8th Level: @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.BTAbeZUzhYhCeRbw]{Divine Strike}</p>\n<p>17th Level: @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.tvfx0Yvn2tvjC7sW]{Stormborn}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB","identifier":"tempest-domain","classIdentifier":"cleric","advancement":[{"_id":"g9vgerz1e7qvqnv0","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.OOjymxRt3nYW4Vkq","Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.OIKVjdXT1T8PZAMm","Compendium.5e-complete.5e-spells.zjff2IdTPpUwWCUj","Compendium.5e-complete.5e-spells.SHmTDvXfGItXBTs6"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"always","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":1,"title":"Tempest Domain Features and Spells","icon":""},{"_id":"ba5qnh409p6i04ad","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.46WyZOUsnGrZ2cJ3"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":2,"title":"Tempest Domain Feature","icon":""},{"_id":"9vucgofhekhhgpz5","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.8cIdV2EU7BC8MW1m"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":6,"title":"Tempest Domain Feature","icon":""},{"_id":"7ek7uokhpzwcmnv0","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.BTAbeZUzhYhCeRbw"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":8,"title":"Tempest Domain Feature","icon":""},{"_id":"86t97cpvcu7t5g85","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.tvfx0Yvn2tvjC7sW"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":17,"title":"Tempest Domain Feature","icon":""},{"_id":"lliw0jgc8fc2ibth","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-spells.NJoboox7UplFADzn","Compendium.5e-complete.5e-spells.6GqRMNBXcKg4Z6x7"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"always","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":3,"title":"Tempest Domain Spells","icon":""},{"_id":"hu5snoabtf4rd3jr","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-spells.bsmm4jV1tMjyU00g","Compendium.5e-complete.5e-spells.sNfU0BaHmjqml2zk"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"always","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":5,"title":"Tempest Domain Spells","icon":""},{"_id":"z9vhca5j2ktx03p4","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-spells.uLXgUtgVTI6Qiyyn","Compendium.5e-complete.5e-spells.rdiygKbI2F4JWVgd"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"always","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":7,"title":"Tempest Domain Spells","icon":""},{"_id":"1oajczpfjkpl33o9","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-spells.2QHWawdXbC6WLHNx","Compendium.5e-complete.5e-spells.ppzHP9AZKXu2IWyz"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"always","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":9,"title":"Tempest Domain Spells","icon":""}],"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":""}},"ownership":{"default":0,"EHpONhziSoZpUpN3":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1664691271233,"lastModifiedBy":"UjfixXuqstXNdypa"}}

Their magic also allows them to stave off a creatureâs death, though they refuse to use such magic to extend a creatureâs lifespan beyond its mortal limits.</p>\n<h3>Grave Domain Spells</h3>\n<table>\n<thead style=\"text-shadow:1px 1px var(--color-shadow-dark);border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-border-dark)\">\n<tr>\n<td>Cleric Level</td>\n<td>Spells</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.Hj5boJxDzzVxwtNw]{Bane}, @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.2qTBrY7kenAWLwTz]{False Life}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.ueK5tTbZxquUhopA]{Gentle Repose}, @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.H0XteaTSNgoAbkvG]{Ray of Enfeeblement}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.JfmldXrY61V0FQC2]{Revivify}, @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.aQAR73hVS8WmCeo6]{Vampiric Touch}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.5T6YkH0115J3oAsg]{Blight}, @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.3x7HVJ1Ube01KuDI]{Death Ward}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.iusFRYv0kuzXVDmg]{Antilife Shell}, @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.WI98cTP5mCQzI7U4]{Raise Dead}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Grave Domain Features</h3>\n<p>1st Level: @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.D9zpH6eXBH3Vmj7a]{Circle of Mortality}, @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.wy9yUSnllXcZFTxh]{Eyes of the Grave}</p>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.zH8Ix9DiH7wXxSRp]{Channel Divinity: Path to the Grave}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.yFNt6NesuI9OegLe]{Sentinel at Death's Door}</p>\n<p>8th Level: @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.Y0TiHzqy4u7xqFMX]{Potent Spellcasting}</p>\n<p>17th Level: @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.strm67MYHHQfkJdr]{Keeper of Souls}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"XGE","identifier":"grave-domain","classIdentifier":"cleric","advancement":[{"_id":"nxs86myfigjo9uca","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.D9zpH6eXBH3Vmj7a","Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.wy9yUSnllXcZFTxh","Compendium.5e-complete.5e-spells.Hj5boJxDzzVxwtNw","Compendium.5e-complete.5e-spells.2qTBrY7kenAWLwTz"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"always","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":1,"title":"Grave Domain Features and Spells","icon":""},{"_id":"yybi8m10aaffzpo1","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.zH8Ix9DiH7wXxSRp"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":2,"title":"Grave Domain Feature","icon":""},{"_id":"3bczzwpqx9p0h45h","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-spells.ueK5tTbZxquUhopA","Compendium.5e-complete.5e-spells.H0XteaTSNgoAbkvG"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"always","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":3,"title":"Grave Domain Spells","icon":""},{"_id":"xgclmkvwxcpzukgh","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-spells.JfmldXrY61V0FQC2","Compendium.5e-complete.5e-spells.aQAR73hVS8WmCeo6"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"always","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":5,"title":"Grave Domain Spells","icon":""},{"_id":"nzh06nydutl1xdlw","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.yFNt6NesuI9OegLe"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":6,"title":"Grave Domain Feature","icon":""},{"_id":"jlqsy49gbydv6fk6","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-spells.5T6YkH0115J3oAsg","Compendium.5e-complete.5e-spells.3x7HVJ1Ube01KuDI"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"always","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":7,"title":"Grave Domain Spells","icon":""},{"_id":"tzywo3we6uampme5","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.Y0TiHzqy4u7xqFMX"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":8,"title":"Grave Domain Feature","icon":""},{"_id":"83v3vwzqvnj0c50n","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.strm67MYHHQfkJdr"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":17,"title":"Grave Domain Feature","icon":""},{"_id":"nz2rhwzcons6w04m","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-spells.iusFRYv0kuzXVDmg","Compendium.5e-complete.5e-spells.WI98cTP5mCQzI7U4"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"always","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":9,"title":"Grave Domain Spells","icon":""}],"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":""}},"ownership":{"default":0,"EHpONhziSoZpUpN3":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1664690788359,"lastModifiedBy":"UjfixXuqstXNdypa"}}
