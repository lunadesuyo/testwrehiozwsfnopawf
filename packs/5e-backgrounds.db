Unlike some people who collect bounties, though, you aren't a savage who follows quarry into or through the wilderness. You're involved in a lucrative trade, in the place where you live, that routinely tests your skills and survival instincts. What's more, you aren't alone, as a bounty hunter in the wild would be: you routinely interact with both the criminal subculture and other bounty hunters, maintaining contacts in both areas to help you succeed.</p>\n<p>You might be a cunning thief-catcher, prowling the rooftops to catch one of the myriad burglars of the city. Perhaps you are someone who has your ear to the street, aware of the doings of thieves' guilds and street gangs. You might be a \"velvet mask\" bounty hunter, one who blends in with high society and noble circles in order to catch the criminals that prey on the rich, whether pickpockets or con artists. The community where you plied your trade might have been one of Faenûn's great metropolises, such as Waterdeep or Baldur's Gate, or a less populous location, perhaps Luskan or Yartar – any place that's large enough to have a steady supply of potential quarries.</p>\n<p>As a member of an adventuring party, you might find it more difficult to pursue a personal agenda that doesn't fit with the group's objectives – but on the other hand, you can take down much more formidable targets with the help of your companions.</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Proficiencies: </strong>Choose two from among Deception, Insight, Persuasion, and Stealth</p>\n<p><strong>Tool Proficiencies: </strong>Choose two from among one type of gaming set, one musical instrument, and thieves' tools</p>\n<p><strong>Languages: </strong>None</p>\n<p><strong>Equipment: </strong>A set of clothes appropriate to your duties and a pouch containing 20gp</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-background-features.CinU76J8CvUETnOf]{Ear to the Ground}</p>\n<p>You are in frequent contact with people in the segment of society that your chosen quarries move through.

Or you could be an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply about the people who live and work on your land, keenly aware of your responsibility to them.</p>\n<p>Work with your DM to come up with an appropriate title and determine how much authority that title carries. A noble title doesn't stand on its own-it's connected to an entire family, and whatever title you hold, you will pass it down to your own children. Not only do you need to determine your noble title, but you should also work with the DM to describe your family and their influence on you.</p>\n<p>Is your family old and established, or was your title only recently bestowed?

If you wish to be a knight, choose the Retainers feature below instead of the Position of Privilege feature. One of your commoner retainers is replaced by a noble who serves as your squire, aiding you in exchange for training on his or her own path to knighthood. Your two remaining retainers might include a groom to care for your horse and a servant who polishes your armor (and even helps you put it on).</p>\n<p>As an emblem of chivalry and the ideals of courtly love, you might include among your equipment a banner or other token from a noble lord or lady to whom you have given your heart – in a chaste sort of devotion.

Your retainers are commoners who can perform mundane tasks for you, but they do not fight for you, will not follow you into obviously dangerous areas (such as dungeons), and will leave if they are frequently endangered or abused.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Suggested Characteristics</h2>\n<p>Nobles are born and raised to a very different lifestyle than most people ever experience, and their personalities reflect that upbringing. A noble title comes with a plethora of bonds –responsibilities to family, to other nobles (including the sovereign), to the people entrusted to the family's care, or even to the title itself.

You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a cleric – performing sacred rites is not the same thing as channeling divine power.</p>\n<p>Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being, and work with your DM to detail the nature of your religious service. Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a high priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps you were the leader of a small cult outside of any established temple structure, or even an occult group that served a fiendish master that you now deny.</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Insight, Religion</p>\n<p><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> None</p>\n<p><strong>Languages:</strong> Two of your choice</p>\n<p><strong>Equipment:</strong> A holy symbol (a gift to you when you entered the priesthood), a @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-items.i8eksavWgdyd2iCX]{Prayer Book} or @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-items.9kNGr3XG0lGgRQz2]{Prayer Wheel}, 5 @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-items.YLIdZj3tQ6KuVPkd]{Sticks of Incense}, @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-items.zg9yeM0eL3nQby4R]{Vestments}, a set of @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-items.gz5m4u0EtUnGZJRU]{Common Clothes}, and a pouch containing 15gp</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-background-features.UjW059v2hYovGzGV]{Shelter the Faithful}</p>\n<p>As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity.

Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.</p>\n<p>You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home.

Their study of the history and tenets of their faith and their relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their mannerisms and ideals.
