You don’t need to have the spell prepared.</p><h3>Spellcasting Focus</h3><p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p><h3>Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h3><p>Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar).</p><h3>Your Spellbook</h3><p>The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p><p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p><p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p><p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p><p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need to spend 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p><p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p><p><em><strong>The Book’s Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"Wizard 1","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"ownership":{"default":0,"LCw1mxC8S2Al3dWA":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1664961869979,"lastModifiedBy":"UjfixXuqstXNdypa"}}

You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p>\n<p>While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you've already cast.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it.

Archetypes</h1>\n<h2>Awakened Mind</h2>\n<p>An Awakened Mind is a psion who had their psionic power awakened within them by an encounter, event, or circumstance. Perhaps their powers were latent or perhaps their destiny had been that of a normal creature until powers were suddenly thrust on them. Perhaps they brushed the Far Realm in a vivid dream, perhaps they wandered the Feywild and came back warped, perhaps they merely glimpsed the eyes of a creature that did not belong walking down the street.</p>\n<p>An awakening is often somewhat traumatic. Psions are not well understood and the first power they manifest - telepathy - is one of the most feared and shunned abilities.</p>\n<p>An Awakened can be either empathetic or cruel, good or evil. Knowing what is on the minds of others affects people in different ways, driving some away from society as they see its true face, while others feel drawn to help the problems only they can see.</p>\n<h3>Awakened Mind Features</h3>\n<p>1st Level: </p>\n<p>3rd Level: </p>\n<p>6th Level: </p>\n<p>10th Level: </p>\n<p>14th Level: </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Unleashed Mind</h2>\n<p>An Unleashed Mind's power is most often an innate force they struggle to understand or control, a reflection of their state of mind and mood projected onto the world around them, often to devastating results. The life of an Unleashed Psion is frequently their journey to control their unruly powers... or one of embracing the destructive powers fully.</p>\n<p>What the wellspring of their innate power is varies - they could be a psionic race, born under the influence of distant twisted powers, warped by fey blood, or a herald of something more sinister brushing against the material world. Sometimes their power will show itself in simple applications, but most often their power becomes known and feared when their temper flares.</p>\n<p>Their alignment frequently depends on the approach to their powers they have taken, an Unleashed Psion who emphasizes control and restraint, keeping their emotions from running wild and their powers from running rampany will most often be lawful, following strict personal codes. On the other hand, an Unleashed Psion who lets their power run rampant will almost always be chaotic in nature, acting on impulse... with great emphasis.</p>\n<h3>Unleashed Mind Features</h3>\n<p>1st Level: </p>\n<p>3rd Level: </p>\n<p>6th Level: </p>\n<p>10th Level: </p>\n<p>14th Level: </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Transcended Mind</h2>\n<p>A Transcended psion is most often one that ahs found their path to psionic powers through a mental epiphany, realizing the place of their mind within the multiverse and how it ties to everything else, seeing the keys and levers to the world laid out before them in their mind's eye.</p>\n<p>Most often achieved either intentionally or accidentally through meditation and ritual, this can sometimes even be a passed on technique to reliably transcend the strictly material concerns, and explore the more cognitive realm and powers within.</p>\n<p>Transcended psions tend to have the best grasp on their powers in control and principle, having come ot understand the greater cosmos, but lack the reckless abandon some other psions may have. Unfortunately, less transcendent minds frequently cannot understand the greater truths they have learned and may view a Trasncended psion as a bit... peculiar.</p>\n<h3>Transcended Mind Features</h3>\n<p>1st Level: </p>\n<p>3rd Level: </p>\n<p>6th Level: </p>\n<p>10th Level: </p>\n<p>14th Level: </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Shaper's Mind</h2>\n<p>An Shaper is a psion that specializes in the materialization of their imagination, projecting it out into the world. No mere conjurers borrowing the powers of other planes, a Shaper manifests things from nothing but their own mind, weaving their creations into existence through the exertion of raw psionic power and imagination.</p>\n<p>A Shaper's mind is a tool of nearly unrivaled power possessing both boundless creativity and inexorable will, but if that will is overrun, the world would do well to fear a Shaper's nightmares.</p>\n<h3>Shaper's Mind Features</h3>\n<p>1st Level: </p>\n<p>3rd Level: </p>\n<p>6th Level: </p>\n<p>10th Level: </p>\n<p>14th Level: </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Wandering Mind</h2>\n<p>An Wandering Mind is among the mroe mysterious incarnates of psions, these are individuals that just aren't quite rooted in the same reality everyone else is... they find it more pliable and slippery, and prone to jumping right through it on occasion.</p>\n<p>How they get their powers varies. Some were born in the ethereal plane or went through a portal while young. Sometimes it is just that their mind just works along an axis most people cannot understand. No matter its source, they manifest a truly unique ability to treat certain aspects of the metaphysical with a certain mundanity, and are prone to treating their powers as absolutely natural things as one might treat an arm or a leg.</p>\n<h3>Wandering Mind Features</h3>\n<p>1st Level: </p>\n<p>3rd Level: </p>\n<p>6th Level: </p>\n<p>10th Level: </p>\n<p>14th Level: </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Elemental Mind</h2>\n<h3>Elemental Mind Features</h3>\n<p>1st Level: </p>\n<p>3rd Level: </p>\n<p>6th Level: </p>\n<p>10th Level: </p>\n<p>14th Level: </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Consuming Mind</h2>\n<p>A dangerous branch of psionics that are born from the ability to sap energy from other creatures, tearing from them their thoughts, their mind, and ultimately their vitality for your own consumption. A feared branch of power, it is often believed to be one of the ancientprimeval roots of psionic power as it is a branch of power found most often the most ancient and terrible of the practitioners of psionics, such as brain-eating squad-faced monsters and ancient psionic space whales, which might have other names in various settings.</p>\n<p>It has been refined by those that seek greater pwoer either from ambition or desperation, and unlocks a terrible but effective path. One example of mortal creatures walking this path is the houses of dark elves, who developed their dark pwoers from their study of feral vampiric brain-eating monsters.</p>\n<h3>Consuming Mind Features</h3>\n<p>1st Level: </p>\n<p>3rd Level: </p>\n<p>6th Level: </p>\n<p>10th Level: </p>\n<p>14th Level: </p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Kibbles' Compendium","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["dex","cha"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["dec","his","ins","itm","inv","med","prc","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"LCw1mxC8S2Al3dWA":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.ILvRZGEx3aXqSVUt"}},"_id":"wSmBDVfH5crGpnDW"}
